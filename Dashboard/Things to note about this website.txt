Current issues:

all html pages - If you use darkmode in the dashboard and move to another html it will go back to light mode (So you will need to
manually press the dark mode again if you want the dark mode version of it)

index.html - when you add more than 10 orders it will overlap with the orders (Simply there should be a scroll bar inside
of the recent orders)

Analytics.html (CSS/JS) - The texts on the barchart and graph are darkened when using dark mode.
